It will be beneficial to note that when the user has\n            resolved the account details, we are automatically triggering the\n            Paystack API that generates a recepient, where by that recepient\n            code is what is later used to actualize the transfer asides the\n            account holders name and account number\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Upon completion of all enteris and given all paramaters are present\n            and available, we can now initialize a transfer with the credentials\n            available with is. Please note that this will not complete because\n            Paystack made me understand that I have to be a registered business\n            to be able to complete a transfer on their platform, therefore the\n            error after the \"Make Transfer\" button is clicked. Not withstanding,\n            it is still very easy to integrate when the conditions are met.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className={classes.paragraph}>\n        <div className={classes.subHeading}>Project Dependencies</div>\n        <div className={classes.content}>\n          <ol>\n            <li>React router dom (for routing)</li>\n            <li>\n              Fontawesome icons for an icon like the responsive hamburger menu\n            </li>\n            <li>Material UI for circular progress for loading states</li>\n            <li>\n              UUID for genberating a unique ID for each transfer and transaction\n            </li>\n          </ol>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectDocumentation;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,mCAAmC;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAExD,MAAMC,oBAAoB,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACjC,oBACED,OAAA;IAASE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACK,SAAU;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACpCJ,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACO,MAAO;MAAAD,QAAA,EAAC;IAAqB;MAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAM,eAC3DT,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;MAAAN,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAAe;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eACzDT,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;QAAAR,QAAA,eAC9BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAI;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;MAAAN,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAEpC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAC9BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;MAAAN,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAEpC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAC9BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAEJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAGH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;MAAAN,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAEpC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAC9BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAKH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAIH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACA;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;MAAAN,QAAA,gBAChCJ,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;QAAAP,QAAA,EAAC;MAAoB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eAC9DT,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAEJ,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;QAAAR,QAAA,eAC9BJ,OAAA;UAAAI,QAAA,gBACEJ,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAA8B;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACvCT,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAEJ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eACLT,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAAoD;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK,eAC7DT,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAI;UAEJ;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAK;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MACF;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACD;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACF;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACE;AAEd,CAAC;AAACI,EAAA,GAvIIZ,oBAAoB;AAyI1B,eAAeA,oBAAoB;AAAC,IAAAY,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
