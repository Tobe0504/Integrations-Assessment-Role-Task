It will be beneficial to note that when the\n              user has resolved the account details, we are automatically\n              triggering the Paystack API that generates a recepient, where by\n              that recepient code is what is later used to actualize the\n              transfer asides the account holders name and account number\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Upon completion of all enteris and given all paramaters are\n              present and available, we can now initialize a transfer with the\n              credentials available with is. Please note that this will not\n              complete because Paystack made me understand that I have to be a\n              registered business to be able to complete a transfer on their\n              platform, therefore the error after the \"Make Transfer\" button is\n              clicked. Not withstanding, it is still very easy to integrate when\n              the conditions are met.\n            </p>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div className={classes.paragraph}>\n          <div className={classes.subHeading}>Project Dependencies</div>\n          <div className={classes.content}>\n            <ol>\n              <li>React router dom (for routing)</li>\n              <li>\n                Fontawesome icons for an icon like the responsive hamburger menu\n              </li>\n              <li>Material UI for circular progress for loading states</li>\n              <li>\n                UUID for genberating a unique ID for each transfer and\n                transaction\n              </li>\n            </ol>\n          </div>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default ProjectDocumentation;\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,gCAAgC;AACnD,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,mCAAmC;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAExD,MAAMC,oBAAoB,GAAGA,CAAA,KAAM;EACjC,oBACED,OAAA,CAACH,MAAM;IAAAK,QAAA,GACJ,GAAG,eACJF,OAAA;MAASG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACM,SAAU;MAAAF,QAAA,gBACpCF,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACO,MAAO;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAC;MAAqB;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAM,eAC3DT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;UAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;QAAe;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACzDT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,eAC9BF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAKH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QAAI;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;UAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;QAEpC;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,gBAC9BF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAKH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;UAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;QAEpC;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,gBAC9BF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAKH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eAEJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAGH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;UAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;QAEpC;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eACNT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,gBAC9BF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAKH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAIH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAMH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UAQH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI,eACJT,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,EAAG;UASH;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAI;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACA;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACF,eAENT,OAAA;QAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACY,SAAU;QAAAR,QAAA,gBAChCF,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACa,UAAW;UAAAT,QAAA,EAAC;QAAoB;UAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAM,eAC9DT,OAAA;UAAKG,SAAS,EAAEL,OAAO,CAACc,OAAQ;UAAAV,QAAA,eAC9BF,OAAA;YAAAE,QAAA,gBACEF,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAA8B;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAK,eACvCT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAEJ;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAK,eACLT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAAoD;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAK,eAC7DT,OAAA;cAAAE,QAAA,EAAI;YAGJ;cAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;cAAAC,UAAA;cAAAC,YAAA;YAAA,QAAK;UAAA;YAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA;QACF;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QACD;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACF;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACE;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACH;AAEb,CAAC;AAACI,EAAA,GA5IIZ,oBAAoB;AA8I1B,eAAeA,oBAAoB;AAAC,IAAAY,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
